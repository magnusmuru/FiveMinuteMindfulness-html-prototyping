                    What even is mindfulness? Is it just a buzzword that means nothing or something more?
                </p>
                <p>
                    When was the last time <span class="purple">you</span> took yourself out of an everyday
                    situation and pondered how <span class="purple">you</span> got
                    there? When was the last time <span class="purple">you</span> went up to a wall in <span
                        class="purple">your</span> house and just ran <span class="purple">your</span> hand over
                    it? Go ahead and try it, we know it sounds stupid at first, but taking a moment just to do
                    something and being present is hard when <span class="purple">you</span> are not used to it.
                    Observing, experiencing and
                    being present is foreign, yet we are conscious of our actions every day.

                </p>
                <p>
                    It is something we have all experienced as kids. As children, we are always present for the
                    things we experience since everything is novel - every occasion, every new thing, every feeling.
                    With age, we focus on our goals and ambitions.
                </p>
                <p> We are always present and listening to our actions and words. Some of <span
                        class="purple">you</span> might even be mindful
                    without realizing that. In essence, that is mindfulness. Taking a step back and seeing yourself
                    in the moment. Taking in all the sensations, such in the way as a child.
                    This is <span class="purple">your</span> first step. There are many who would say that <span
                            class="purple">you</span> should do this and that – we
                    don’t believe in that. Mindfulness is extremely personal and there is no easy sure fire 5-step
                    plan that someone can take to show how <span class="purple">you</span> express it. Just come and
                    enjoy the journey.
