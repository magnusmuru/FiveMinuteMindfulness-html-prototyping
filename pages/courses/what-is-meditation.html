                    <h2>What is meditation?</h2>
                    <p>
                        When <span class="purple">you</span> picture meditation do <span class="purple">you</span>
                        imagine sitting cross-legged on the floor and following a
                        certain
                        rhythm? Do <span class="purple">you</span> imagine listening to a guided style of meditation
                        which tells <span class="purple">you</span> to slow down
                        and
                        breathe? Maybe some of these methods work for <span class="purple">you</span> and that is great,
                        but some of <span class="purple">you</span> might have
                        always imagined meditation to be only that.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Be it limited by time or by the matter <span class="purple">you</span> partake, it forces <span
                            class="purple">you</span> to focus in a certain way, and
                        perhaps that way does not work for <span class="purple">you</span>. Don’t get us wrong, there is
                        strong research that backs
                        the
                        tangible benefits of meditation and most of these have been measured in such controlled
                        environments.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        But life is chaotic. There is school, work, <span class="purple">your</span> hobbies, family,
                        recreation and the list goes
                        on
                        and on and on… Sometimes finding that space to follow along is difficult and that makes a lot of
                        people give up if they can’t get it going on the first couple tries. As such, imagine having to
                        give
                        up as soon as <span class="purple">you</span> start since <span class="purple">you</span> hit
                        that mental roadblock.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        A lot of us live our lives extremely goal oriented, since this is the way society grows most
                        people.
                        We forget the journey, not willingly but because it is so integral to out way of life. This
                        compounds the first failure that keeps people from exploring themselves internally, because like
                        many things it is hard at first. That is already a mental conundrum – how could it be hard to
                        know
                        yourself if <span class="purple">you</span> have been yourself <span class="purple">your</span>
                        own life? Yet, research shows the constant barrage of
                        information we face daily has made us forget who we are.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Therefore, the first goal of meditation shouldn’t be arriving at the goal as soon as possible,
                        but
                        instead creating the platform of meditation. For example, if <span class="purple">you</span>
                        listen to anyone who partakes
                        in
                        recreational sports, like jogging or yoga, they often compare this time they spend to
                        meditation.
                        Some people find their meditation in the faith they partake in, some go see the stars and the
                        moon,
                        others find a quiet spot and just walk around. There is no right answer to put in a book and
                        call it
                        a day.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So go out there and try different things, explore yourself and do not give up at the first of
                        failure. Go on a walk, go partake in a guided meditation, go look outside and just think with
                        yourself. 5-10 minutes a day can make a big difference from taking self-reflection and
                        meditation
                        from an unconscious thing we do every day into a mindful behavior that expands who <span
                            class="purple">you</span> are.
                    </p>
                </div>

                        </span>
                    </button>
                </div>
            </div>
