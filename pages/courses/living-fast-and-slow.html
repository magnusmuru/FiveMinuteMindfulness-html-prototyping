                <h2>Living fast and slow</h2>
            </div>
            <p>
                From traditional media to social platforms and new unseen virtual reality worlds that we are
                conjuring
                up today – we are living in a world that has pressed the pedal through the floor. While generally we
                have adjusted to most of the complexity, our evolution that has gradually led us to this point over
                tens
                of thousands of years, has not caught up. And this is only regarding the information we assess, not
                to
                mention every other aspect of our life.
            </p>

            <p>
                Even the most highly functioning people in our ever-complicating society have realized that <span
                    class="purple">you</span>
                cannot
                fight this fact – we need to take the time to slow down. This in essence is living fast and slow at
                the
                same time and creating a mindful schedule that considers these high fluctuations. Practicing
                mindfulness
                can help <span class="purple">you</span> understand how to better deal with the stress that arises and
                helps <span class="purple">you</span> wind it down to
                more manageable speed of life.
            </p>

            <p>
                Has <span class="purple">your</span> mind wandered off in the middle of something? Sure, it has and
                usually that’s because we
                are
                not present. While sometimes life gives us situations that we would rather be anywhere else, being
                present and mindful allows <span class="purple">you</span> to take a step back and assess in any kind of
                situation. Maybe things
                can
                be changed, maybe there are short- or long-term course corrections that can be taken to avoid these
                kinds of situations, maybe it just happened to be one of those days. There are a lot of maybes and
                allowing yourself a minute to take yourself out of our day-to-day and assess can lead to the right
                questions.
            </p>

            <p>
                And its by asking these questions about yourself and seeking the journey that brings <span
                    class="purple">you</span> closer to
                answers is the essence of mindfulness. Sometimes they strike <span class="purple">you</span> while <span
                    class="purple">you</span> are focusing on being
                mindful
                in peace and comfort, sometimes it strikes <span class="purple">you</span> in the middle of a class or
                meeting. Taking the time
                to
                assess in those situations and unpacking further afterwards allows <span class="purple">you</span>
                better to understand
                yourself.
            </p>
